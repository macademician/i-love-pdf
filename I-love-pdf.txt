Title: "I Love PDF"

(Verse 1)
Saw them papers in the corner, stacked up high and wide
I knew I needed them for research, couldn't leave 'em behind
That old world's fading, and I ain't got the space
But there's a digital solution, gonna put a smile on my face

(Chorus)
I love PDF, put another paper on my screen, baby
I love PDF, so come and share your knowledge with me

(Verse 2)
I saw a citation that caught my eye, I knew I had to find
That groundbreaking research, to expand my mind
I clicked the link, and there it was, a PDF so fine
It's portable and versatile, oh, it's about time

(Chorus)
I love PDF, put another paper on my screen, baby
I love PDF, so come and share your knowledge with me

(Bridge)
Now don't you worry 'bout the trees, we're saving them, you see
Digital's the way to go, for a sustainable degree
You can highlight, annotate, and search with ease
The world of knowledge in your hands, like a gentle breeze

(Verse 3)
So let's embrace the future, leave the past behind
With digital archives, there's so much we can find
From the sciences to the arts, it's a treasure trove untold
Oh, I love PDF, it's the future we've been sold

(Chorus)
I love PDF, put another paper on my screen, baby
I love PDF, so come and share your knowledge with me

(Outro)
I love PDF, let's share the wisdom of the world, baby
I love PDF, together we'll explore and set our minds free
