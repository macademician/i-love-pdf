(Verse 1)
I saw them reading there by the bookstand light
A mountain of pages, it was a crazy sight
I knew they had the knowledge that I need
To satisfy my curiosity

(Chorus)
I love PDF, so put another file in my library, baby
I love PDF, so come and share your knowledge with me

(Verse 2)
Pages were turning, I could feel the thrill
Of information, baby, that I'd soon distill
I said, "Can I have it, baby, in a digital form?"
They smiled and said, "Sure, it's the new norm."

(Chorus)
I love PDF, so put another file in my library, baby
I love PDF, so come and share your knowledge with me

(Bridge)
Research's where I'll be, citations dancing free
With the digital copies that set my mind at ease

(Verse 3)
We kept on searching through the late, late night
Finding articles, baby, that would change our lives
And now we've got the answers that we crave
A thousand PDFs, we'll gladly save

(Chorus)
I love PDF, so put another file in my library, baby
I love PDF, so come and share your knowledge with me

(Outro)
I love PDF, so put another file in my library, baby
I love PDF, so come and share your knowledge with me
